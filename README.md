## RLC Series Circuit Sim  
This project was made as a part of my Applied Numerical Science class.  
It was written in Visual Studio using python.  
The project evaluates the equation of an RLC circuit iteratively, solving for current and charge at every time step.  
Results are plotted on graphs using pylab.
